### Introduction <a href="#_toc109836811" id="_toc109836811"></a>

Dear colleagues,

This guide will introduce the Client Interface available on the USupport mobile app. It is a central feature that provides users with access to valuable psychological resources, meticulously crafted by experts, and enables them to connect with mental health service providers for one-on-one sessions to enhance their overall mental well-being.

### What is the Mobile app? <a href="#ole_link2" id="ole_link2"></a>

The USupport project provides a custom-built mobile application for iOS and Android devices, called the mobile application, which is designed for users seeking reliable psychological support.

The mobile app offers an easy-to-use interface that allows users to access a wide range of psychological resources and engage in one-to-one online consultations with professional service providers to improve their mental health.

### Processes

### 1.   Register into the Client Interface

Step 1:       Open the mobile application.

Step 2:       Select a country and a language from the Welcome Screen.

Step 3:       From the next screen select one of the registration options ‚ÄúRegister with email‚Äù or ‚ÄúRegister anonymously‚Äù (see Figure 2).

Step 4:       Insert valid login credentials - either an email or an access token.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (136).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Welcome Screen</p></figcaption></figure>



<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (148).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 2: Client Interface entry screen</p></figcaption></figure>

#### 1.1.        Registration Options

#### &#x20;

All the registration options are highlighted in Figure 2.

Option 1: This option requires the client to register using an existing email address. This registration method provides full access to the features available within the client interface.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (125).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 3: Registration with email Step 1</p></figcaption></figure>

The first step for registering into the platform using Option 1 is to provide a valid email address which was not used for previous registrations, a nickname and a password. Additionally, the client is required to agree with the ‚ÄúPrivacy Policy‚Äù and ‚ÄúTerms of Conditions‚Äù.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (147).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 4:  Registration with email Step 2</p></figcaption></figure>

The second step in the option 1 registration flow requires further information such as name, surname, sex, year of birth and place of living. This information will be securely stored by the platform and can be modified by the client later on from the account settings.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Registration Step 3</p></figcaption></figure>

The third step for this registration option asks the client if he/she needs urgent support. In case the client‚Äôs answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù, the application will automatically redirect the user to schedule an appointment for psychological support. This procedure will be described later on.

Option 2: This option allows the client to get access to the mobile app anonymously. This means that no personal identifiable information is required from the client, apart from a nickname and password. By choosing this option, the client will be provided with a unique access token that needs to be securely saved for future use. In comparison with the email registration presented above, using this type of registration means that there is no link between the client and the account on the platform. Following this, it is very important to understand that the access token generated in the registration process is the only key to access the account in the future and the client should make sure to remember it every time they want to log in.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (123).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 6:  Anonymously registration Step 1</p></figcaption></figure>

The first step for registration option 2 differs slightly from the previous option. Specifically, the email field (see Figure 3) is replaced by a unique access token (see in Figure 6).

The second step of this registration flow is similar to the third step of the previously discussed option 1, asking the client if he/she requires urgent support (see Figure 5).

Option 3: This option allows the client to get access to the mobile application without going through the registration process. By using this option, the client can explore the limited features available for non-registered users and decide if they would like to fully register by creating an account.

### 2.   Login to the mobile application

Step 1:       Open the USupport mobile application

Step 2:       Select a country and a language from the Welcome Screen.

Step 3:       From the next screen select ‚ÄúLogin to the app‚Äù button (see Figure 2)

Step 4:       Insert valid login credentials - either an email or an access token

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (153).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 7: Login screen</p></figcaption></figure>

### 3.   Forgot Password

Step 1:       Open the USupport mobile application.

Step 2:       Select a country and a language from the Welcome Screen.

Step 3:       From the next screen select ‚ÄúLogin to the app‚Äù button (see Figure 2).

Step 4:       Select ‚ÄúI forgot my password‚Äù see Figure 7.

Step 5:       Insert a valid email address see Figure 8.

Step 6:       Check your email address for recovery email.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (152).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 8: Forgot Password Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

If a valid and registered email address within the platform was provided, an automated email will be sent to it. The email will contain a temporary valid link that can be used to set a new password. Following this procedure, the user can access the account using the email address and the new set password.

### 4.   Schedule a consultation

Step 1:       Login to the  mobile application.

Step 2:       On the ‚ÄúNavigation Menu‚Äù select ‚ÄúConsultations‚Äù icon which is the third button in the menu.

Step 3:       Click the ‚ÄúSchedule a consultation‚Äù button see Figure 9.

Step 4:       From the list of providers select one to preview his/her details see Figure 10.

Step 5:       From the provider overview screen select the ‚ÄúSchedule consultation‚Äù button see Figure 11.

Step 6:       From the time availability pop-up select date and time and click the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button see Figure 12.

Step 7:       Once the appointment is scheduled a confirmation pop-up will be shown see Figure 17.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (142).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 9: Consultations Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Figure 9 presents the consultations screen. Two different tabs can be seen in the middle of the screen, namely ‚ÄúUpcoming‚Äù and ‚ÄúPast. These are available in order to provide the client with the capability to track their previous appointments with providers and their upcoming ones. We can notice that at this stage there are no upcoming appointments therefore this is clearly indicated, using an appropriate message ‚ÄúYou have no upcoming consultations‚Äù.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (138).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 10: Select a Provider Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Each shadowed box, as highlighted in red in Figure 10, represents a provider profile.

Initially, upon accessing this screen, the client will see a default list of available providers. However, if the user has a coupon code, they can enter it into the system, and the platform will generate an updated list of providers that participate in the campaign associated with that coupon. Moreover, clients have the ability to filter for free consultations or establish a maximum price according to their preferences.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (157).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 11: Using coupon code for finding providers</p></figcaption></figure>

To utilize a coupon code, users must input a valid code into the designated field displayed in Figure 11. Once they click the "Submit coupon" button and the code is successfully validated, the list of providers will be updated to display only those who are participating in the campaign associated with the coupon. This updated list will be shown in Figure 12.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (156).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 12: List of providers for valid coupon</p></figcaption></figure>

By clicking on the "Remove coupon" button located in the top right corner, the user can eliminate the coupon filter.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (161).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 13: Filtering options for the list of providers</p></figcaption></figure>

Furthermore, the client has the ability to filter providers using the options displayed in Figure 13, which are also listed below.

Providers filtering options:

* Type of provider
* Gender
* Maximum price
* Language
* Free consultations
* Available after
* Available before

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.34.11.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 14: Provider Overview Screen</p></figcaption></figure>



Clicking on any of the listed providers allows the client to access additional information about their background and support capabilities, as depicted in Figure 14. This feature provides the client with a more in-depth understanding of each provider, allowing them to make a more informed decision when selecting a provider to work with.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (159).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 15: Select the appointment date and time</p></figcaption></figure>

Once a client decides to progress with scheduling an appointment with a specific provider and clicks the ‚ÄúSchedule consultation‚Äù button (see Figure 14) they will be presented with the time availability of the provider. This is represented by a back drop, as presented in Figure 15 from where the client can select a month, day and time and find a slot for the consultation. Additionally, clients have the option to utilize a coupon in this section as well. If the provider has set availability, the corresponding slots related to the entered coupon will be displayed.

Note: The slots that are presented here are based on the availability put in place by the specific provider. There might be days that don‚Äôt have available slots due to either the provider being fully booked or the provider not being available for consultations on that specific date.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.35.02.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 16:  Payment screen within consultation booking process</p></figcaption></figure>

After choosing a consultation slot, the user will be directed to proceed with the payment. Figure 16 illustrates what details are required to complete the final step of booking a consultation. Two crucial aspects of the payment screen are worth noting. The first is that the time counter, although not presented on the screen, begins counting down from 5 minutes as soon as the payment screen is loaded. This counter indicates the duration for which the selected consultation slot is reserved and cannot be booked by other clients. If the time runs out, the client can no longer make the payment, and the slot becomes available again to all clients. If the client still wishes to book the same slot after the time has expired, they must select it again, provided it is still available and has not been booked by another user. The second important element on the screen is the total cost of the consultation, which will be charged to the user.

Note: The payment form is presented in more details in section 10 Make a payment

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (162).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 17: Payment and Appointment confirmation</p></figcaption></figure>

&#x20;After a successful payment and registration of the booking by the system, the user will be shown the confirmation screen, as depicted in Figure 17.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (52).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 18: Unsuccessful payment screen</p></figcaption></figure>

In the event that the payment is unsuccessful, the user will be directed to the screen displayed in Figure 18. This screen provides the user with relevant information and instructions for resolving the payment issue and completing the transaction.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (53).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 19: Consultations screen visualises upcoming appointments</p></figcaption></figure>

As previously mentioned, all the upcoming consultations can be seen within the Consultations Screen, as shown above.

### 5.   Edit consultation

Step 1:       Login to the Mobile application.

Step 8:       On the ‚ÄúNavigation Menu‚Äù select ‚ÄúConsultations‚Äù icon which is the third button in the menu.

Step 2:       Find the consultation that needs to be edited.

Step 3:       Select the ‚Äúedit‚Äù button.

Step 4:       From the displayed pop-up select one of the two options ‚ÄúChange the date and time‚Äù or ‚ÄúCancel the consultation‚Äù.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (65).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 20: Consultation screen edit appointment</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (127).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 21: Consultation screen edit appointment options</p></figcaption></figure>

The first option ‚ÄúChange the date and time‚Äù will prompt the client to select another time slot from the availability of the same provider. The process is similar to the booking an appointment one.

The second option ‚ÄúCancel the consultation‚Äù will cancel the appointment for both the client and the provider.

Note:

* All changes made to an appointment will be confirmed using the notification service in app and by email for both of the consultation participants.
* Refunds for paid consultations will only be issued if the appointment is cancelled at least 24 hours prior to its scheduled start time.

### 6.   Access the Information portal

Step 1:       Login to the Mobile application.

Step 2:       On the ‚ÄúNavigation Menu‚Äù select ‚ÄúInformation Portal‚Äù icon which is the second button in the navigation menu.

Step 3:       Select the ‚ÄúView all‚Äù buttons on the right hand side, see Figure 22.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.37.14.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 22: Information Portal initial screen</p></figcaption></figure>

The initial entry screen for the information portal, as presented in Figure 22 is divided into two article groups - newest and most popular. For each section clients can choose the ‚ÄúView all‚Äù button which will redirect them to the Search screen in which more functionalities can be used to find the right content (see Figure 23).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (164).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 23: Information Portal Search Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Clients can use the search input to find different articles. Following the client's input, the view will dynamically update by displaying the articles that match the search criteria. Furthermore, clients can filter articles by choosing from a list of predefined categories.

Once the client finds an article about which he/she wants to read more, he/she can do so by selecting the ‚ÄúRead more‚Äù button within the article overview box, as highlighted in Figure 23.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.38.19.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 24: Full view of an article</p></figcaption></figure>

Figure 24 shows the full view of an article. The first part is a cover image. Next, we are presented with a list of tags that represent different psychological topics that are covered by the article. Following this, the title of the article together with the body and bibliography are displayed.

Note:

* Translations are supported as well. When changing the language, the clients will be presented with the translated version of the articles. In case some of the articles do not have a translated version for a specific language, then it will not be shown under the selected language.

### 7.   Access the SOS Center

Step 1:       Login to the Mobile application.

Step 2:       Select the ‚ÄúSOS Center‚Äù button on the bottom right corner from any screen within the USupport mobile applicaiton.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (150).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 25: SOS Centers Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

The SOS centre screen is the place which provides quick access to emergency lines available in different countries.

Figure 25 presents the available helplines, each within a different rectangle. The information which can be displayed is the following:

* Name of the emergency centre
* A description which should include relevant details about the centre so that the clients can know if the specific centre can solve their issue.
* A ‚ÄúContact now‚Äù button is displayed if the helpline accepts direct calls.
* A ‚ÄúVisit website‚Äù button is displayed if the helpline has a website.

Note:

* Translations are supported as well. When changing the language, the clients will be presented with the translated version of the SOS centres. In case an SOS centre does not have a translated version for a specific language, then it will be excluded from the results under that specific language.

### 8.   Edit profile settings

Step 1:       Login to the Mobile Application.

Step 2:       On the top left click the ‚ÄúProfile Icon‚Äù select ‚ÄúYour Profile‚Äù (see Figure 26 & Figure 27).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (149).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 26: Access mobile application settings</p></figcaption></figure>

From this screen the client can proceed with the following actions:

* Change their account personal details.
* Preview mood tracker past activity.
* Change settings for Passcode and Biometrics
* Change the notification settings.
* Provide feedback for the application.
* Visualise payment History
* Raise an issue to the country administrator.
* Access the privacy policy.
* Access the frequently asked questions.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.39.24.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 27: Client account settings screen</p></figcaption></figure>

By accessing the profile details screen, the client can visualise the personal information associated with the USupport mobile applicaiton account, see Figure 27-. The client is able to change this data by selecting the ‚ÄúSave changes‚Äù button.

Moreover, from here the client can change the password for the account, enable or disable consent for personal data processing, log out and delete the account.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.39.51.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 28: Edit profile details screen</p></figcaption></figure>

The "Passcode and Biometrics" screen presents the client with two options for securing and accessing the application. The first option is to establish an access code, which can be personalized to the client's preference and will be required every time the application is opened. This access code provides an added layer of security and prevents unauthorized access to the client's information.

The second option is to enable biometrics functionality such as touch ID or face ID, which allows for faster and more seamless access to the application. Biometric authentication utilizes the unique physiological characteristics of the client, such as their fingerprint or facial features, to grant access without the need for manual entry of a passcode. This not only saves time but also enhances the user experience by providing a more intuitive and effortless way of accessing the application.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.40.19.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 29: Settings biometrics screen</p></figcaption></figure>

From the bottom navigation, the client can access the mood tracker past activity page from where they can keep track of their progress while using the platform and see how their state of mind evolves.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (158).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 30:Mood Tracker screen</p></figcaption></figure>

From the notification settings screen the client can enable or disable the email notifications or the scheduled appointments notifications. Furthermore, clients can choose how long before an appointment they want to be notified - 15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes (see Figure 31).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (163).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 31: Notifications settings screen</p></figcaption></figure>

The application feedback form can be accessed as well from the profile settings. This form was created so that clients can provide their opinion about the platform. The screen, as we can see in the , contains two parts, a star rating and a text message field. Once the client submits their feedback and sends the rating this will be received by the country administrators and managed accordingly.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (146).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 32: Application Feedback screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Moreover, users can modify the language settings within the application from the profile settings, see Figure 33

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (70).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 33: Change Language screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Clients are able to view a complete record of their purchases on the platform through the 'payment history' screen. This screen displays details such as the service purchased, the total price paid, and the date and time of the payment.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.42.23.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 34: Payment History screen</p></figcaption></figure>

To obtain more detailed information about a specific payment, the client can select the "More details" option located on the right-hand side of the screen, which will display comprehensive payment details. Furthermore, this feature also enables the client to download the payment receipt associated with the transaction (see Figure 35). Furthermore, clients have the option to export the data in CSV format by simply clicking the "Export" button.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 35: Payment History more information about a payment.</p></figcaption></figure>

The ‚Äòcontact us‚Äô screen allows clients to raise any questions or issues they might encounter. These will be received and addressed by the country administrators. To raise an enquiry, the client needs to select an issue from a predefined list and add any message, if necessary (see Figure 36).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (122).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 36: Contact us screen</p></figcaption></figure>

The privacy policy can be previewed from the profile settings screen, as well.

Note:

* Privacy policies, terms of use and cookie policies are country specific. Clients should read and make sure the existing content is understood and their activity within the platform follows the established rules.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (140).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 37: Privacy policies screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Within frequently asked questions clients can find answers to the most commonly asked questions. It is recommended to visit this page every time there is any ambiguity regarding the use of the platform as the answer already might be there.

The information which is presented on this screen is managed by the country administrators and is country specific.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (160).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 38: Frequently asked questions screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Note:

* Translations are supported as well. When changing the language, the clients will be presented with the translated version of the FAQs. In case some of them do not have a translated version for a specific language, then they will be excluded from the results under that specific language.

### 9.   Access the dashboard

Step 1:       Login to the Mobile Application.

Step 2:       On the ‚ÄúNavigation Menu‚Äù select ‚ÄúHome‚Äù icon which is the first button in the menu..

This screen provides quick access to different functionalities provided within the mobile application interface, which have all been covered within this document, see Figure 39.

The top of the screen displays the client's upcoming consultation and provides an option to manage it. Directly below this, the client can quickly access the mood tracker. Using this feature, they can record their current emotional state by selecting one of the presented options, such as happy, good, sad, depressed, or worried, and adding an explanation if desired. Once the client submits this information, it will be stored in the system and used to generate an ongoing overview of their mood over time.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.44.09.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 39: Dashboard screen</p></figcaption></figure>

### 10.     Make a payment

Step 1:       Login to the Mobile application.

Step 2:       Follow the ‚ÄòSchedule consultation‚Äô flow described in section 4 Schedule a consultation.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (139).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 40: Payment form</p></figcaption></figure>

Clients who wish to make a payment will be directed to the payment screen, where they can enter their payment details manually or use the auto fill functionality by scanning their card using the camera of their phone.

Payment required fields include:

* Card number
* Expiry date of the card
* CVC code
* Country or region
* Additional details required based on country (e.g. postcode for United Kingdom)

When using the auto fill feature to scan the card using the phone camera, the card number and expiry date will be automatically filled in for the client. However, the CVC code will need to be entered separately by the user, along with the country or region and any additional details required based on the country. This convenient feature still saves time and reduces the risk of errors when entering payment information.

### 11.  Access My Q\&A

Step 1:       Login to the Mobile Application.

Step 2:       On the bottom navigation click ‚ÄúMessage Icon‚Äù

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.45.22.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 41: My Q&#x26;A screen.</p></figcaption></figure>

This screen allows clients to access a question and answer directory that is designed to help them clarify any questions they may have. Clients can ask questions anonymously and experienced providers will provide answers to them. The answers to questions will also be available to other clients.

As shown in Figure 41, the questions are organized into different tabs: All, Most Popular, Newest, and Your Questions. The first tab presents all the questions raised on the platform and answered by providers. The tab category displays the questions that are most popular, based on the number of likes they have received from clients. The third tab shows the newest questions that have been raised. The fourth tab displays the questions raised by the current client.

To ask a new question, clients need to click on the ‚ÄúAsk anonymously‚Äù button on the right side of the screen, then add their question as shown in Figure 2. After the client has finished adding their question, they can submit it by clicking the ‚ÄúSend your question‚Äù button. Following this procedure, the question will be displayed in the ‚ÄúYour Questions‚Äù tab and will be available to providers.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 10.46.06.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 42: My Q&#x26;A ad new question.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (154).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 43: My Q&#x26;A entry example.</p></figcaption></figure>



The My Q\&A screen contains several elements for each entry, as shown in Figure 3:

* Title
* Tags
* Question
* Answer
* The provider who answered the question

Additional features include:

* A shortcut to schedule a consultation
* Like/dislike buttons
* A "Read more" option

The schedule consultation shortcut is located in the bottom right corner of the entry and is displayed when a provider has answered the question. This allows clients to easily book a consultation with the provider who provided an answer on the topic they raised.

The like and dislike functionality can be accessed using the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons in the top right corner. The counters displayed indicate the number of clients who have expressed their opinion.

The read more functionality allows clients to view the entire answer to a question, as shown in Figure 4.
