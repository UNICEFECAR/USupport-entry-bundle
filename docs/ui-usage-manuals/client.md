### Introduction

Dear colleagues,

This guide will present the Client Interface which is part of the uSupport platform. It is a core element that allows users to get access to useful psychological resources, which are carefully created by professionals, and engage with psychological service providers in one-to-one sessions that aim to improve their general mental health.

### What is the Client Interface?

The Client Interface is a custom-built web-based application for users that are looking for reliable psychological support within the uSupport project.

This platform aims to deliver an easy-to-use interface that provides the capability to access psychological reading resources, and perform one-to-one online consultations with psychological service providers.

### Processes <a href="#_ref122386267" id="_ref122386267"></a>

### 1. Register into the Client Interface

Step 1: Navigate to the Client Interface (https://usupport.online/client)

Step 2: Select a country and a language from the Welcome Screen.

Step 3: From the next screen select one of the registration options ‚ÄúRegister with email‚Äù or ‚ÄúRegister anonymously‚Äù (see Figure 2).

Step 4: Insert valid login credentials - either an email or an access token.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Welcome Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (84).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 2: Client Interface entry screen</p></figcaption></figure>

#### 1.1. Registration Options

All the registration options are highlighted in Figure 2.

Option 1: This option requires the client to register using an existing email address. This registration method provides full access to the features available within the client interface.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (105).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 3: Registration with email Step 1</p></figcaption></figure>

The first step for registering into the platform using Option 1 is to provide a valid email address which was not used for previous registrations, a nickname a and password. Additionally, the client is required to agree with the ‚ÄúPrivacy Policy‚Äù and ‚ÄúTerms of Conditions‚Äù and complete reCAPTCHA verification.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 4: Registration with email Step 2</p></figcaption></figure>

The second step in the option 1 registration flow requires further information such as name, surname, sex, year of birth and place of living. This information will be securely stored by the platform and can be modified by the client later on from the account settings.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (107).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Registration Step 3</p></figcaption></figure>

The third step for this registration option asks the client if he/she needs urgent support. In case the client‚Äôs answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù, the platform will automatically redirect the user to schedule an appointment for psychological support. This procedure will be described later on.

Option 2: This option allows the client to get access to the client interface anonymously. This means that no personal identifiable information is required from the client, apart from a nickname and password. By choosing this option, the client will be provided with a unique access token that needs to be securely saved for future use. In comparison with the email registration presented above, using this type of registration means that there is no link between the client and the account on the platform. Following this, it is very important to understand that the access token generated in the registration process is the only key to access the account in the future and the client should make sure to remember it every time they want to log in.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 6: Anonymously registration Step 1</p></figcaption></figure>

The first step for registration option 2 differs slightly from the previous option. Specifically, the email field (see Figure 3) is replaced by a unique access token (see in Figure 6).

The second step of this registration flow is similar to the third step of the previously discussed option 1, asking the client if he/she requires urgent support (see Figure 5).

Option 3: This option allows the client to get access to the client interface without going through the registration process. By using this option, the client can explore the limited features available for non-registered users and decide if they would like to fully register by creating an account.

### 2. Login to the Client Interface <a href="#_toc123778358" id="_toc123778358"></a>

Step 1: Navigate to the Client Interface (https://usupport.online/client).

Step 2: Select a country and a language from the Welcome Screen.

Step 3: From the next screen select ‚ÄúLogin to the app‚Äù button (see Figure 2)

Step 4: Insert valid login credentials - either an email or an access token

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 7: Login screen</p></figcaption></figure>

### 3. Forgot Password <a href="#_toc123778359" id="_toc123778359"></a>

Step 1: Navigate to the Client Interface (https://usupport.online/client)

Step 2: Select a country and a language from the Welcome Screen.

Step 3: From the next screen select ‚ÄúLogin to the app‚Äù button (see Figure 2).

Step 4: Select ‚ÄúI forgot my password‚Äù see Figure 3.

Step 5: Insert a valid email address see Figure 8.

Step 6: Check your email address for recovery email.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (77).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 8: Forgot Password Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

If a valid and registered email address within the platform was provided, an automated email will be sent to it. The email will contain a temporary valid link that can be used to set a new password. Following this procedure, the user can access the account using the email address and the new set password.

### 4. Schedule a consultation <a href="#_ref130341728" id="_ref130341728"></a>

Step 1: Login to the Client Interface.

Step 2: On the ‚ÄúNavigation Menu‚Äù select ‚ÄúConsultations‚Äù.

Step 3: Click the ‚ÄúSchedule a consultation‚Äù button see Figure 9.

Step 4: From the list of providers select one to preview his/her details see Figure 14.

Step 5: From the provider overview screen select the ‚ÄúSchedule consultation‚Äù button .

Step 6: From the time availability pop-up select date and time and click the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button see Figure 15

Step 7: Once the appointment is scheduled a confirmation pop-up will be shown see Figure 17

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (128).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 9: Consultations Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Figure 9 presents the consultations screen. Two different tabs can be seen in the middle of the screen, namely ‚ÄúUpcoming‚Äù and ‚ÄúPast. These are available in order to provide the client with the capability to track their previous appointments with providers and their upcoming ones. We can notice that at this stage there are no upcoming appointments therefore this is clearly indicated, using an appropriate message ‚ÄúYou have no upcoming consultations‚Äù.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (91).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 10: Select a Provider Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Each shadowed box, as highlighted in red in Figure 10, represents a provider profile.

Initially, upon accessing this screen, the client will see a default list of available providers. However, if the user has a coupon code, they can enter it into the system, and the platform will generate an updated list of providers that participate in the campaign associated with that coupon.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (109).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 11: Using coupon code for finding providers</p></figcaption></figure>

To utilize a coupon code, users must input a valid code into the designated field displayed in Figure 11. Once they click the "Submit coupon" button and the code is successfully validated, he list of providers will be updated to display only those who are participating in the campaign associated with the coupon. This updated list will be shown in Figure 12

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 12: List of providers for valid coupon</p></figcaption></figure>

By clicking on the "Remove coupon" button located in the top right corner, the user can eliminate the coupon filter.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (87).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 13: Filtering options for the list of providers</p></figcaption></figure>

Furthermore, the client has the ability to filter providers using the options displayed in Figure 13, which are also listed below.

Providers filtering options:

- Type of provider
- Gender
- Free consultations
- Available after
- Available before
- Maximum price
- Language

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (99).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 14: Provider Overview Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Clicking on any of the listed providers allows the client to access additional information about their background and support capabilities, as depicted in Figure 14. This feature provides the client with a more in-depth understanding of each provider, allowing them to make a more informed decision when selecting a provider to work with.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 15: Select the appointment date and time</p></figcaption></figure>

Once a client decides to progress with scheduling an appointment with a specific provider and clicks the ‚ÄúSchedule consultation‚Äù button (see Figure 14) they will be presented with the time availability of the provider. This is represented by a pop-up, as presented in Figure 15, from where the client can select a month, day and time and find a slot for the consultation.

Note: The slots that are presented here are based on the availability put in place by the specific provider. There might be days that don‚Äôt have available slots due to either the provider being fully booked or the provider not being available for consultations on that specific date.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (90).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 16: Payment screen within consultation booking process</p></figcaption></figure>

After choosing a consultation slot, the user will be directed to proceed with payment. Figure 16 illustrates what payment details are required to complete the final step of booking a consultation. Two crucial aspects of the payment screen are worth noting. The first is the time counter, located at the top of the form, which shows the remaining time to complete the payment. The countdown begins at 5 minutes and indicates the duration the selected consultation slot is reserved and cannot be booked by other clients. If the time runs out, the client can no longer make the payment, and the slot becomes available again to all clients. If the client still wishes to book the same slot after the time has expired, they must select it again, provided it is still available and has not been booked by another user. The second important element on the screen is the total cost of the consultation, which will be charged to the user.

Note: The payment form is presented in more details in section 10 Make a payment

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (55).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 17: Payment and Appointment confirmation</p></figcaption></figure>

After a successful payment and registration of the booking by the system, the user will be shown the confirmation screen, as depicted in Figure 17.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 18: Unsuccessful payment screen</p></figcaption></figure>

In the event that the payment is unsuccessful, the user will be directed to the screen displayed in Figure 18. This screen provides the user with relevant information and instructions for resolving the payment issue and completing the transaction.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (64).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 19: Consultations screen visualises upcoming appointments</p></figcaption></figure>

As previously mentioned, all the upcoming consultations can be seen within the Consultations Screen, as shown above.

### 5. Edit consultation

Step 1: Login to the Client Interface.

Step 2: On the ‚ÄúNavigation Menu‚Äù select ‚ÄúConsultations‚Äù.

Step 3: Find the consultation that needs to be edited.

Step 4: Select the ‚Äúedit‚Äù button.

Step 5: From the displayed pop-up select one of the two options ‚ÄúChange the date and time‚Äù or ‚ÄúCancel the consultation‚Äù.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 20: Consultation screen edit appointment</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 21: Consultation screen edit appointment options</p></figcaption></figure>

The first option ‚ÄúChange the date and time‚Äù will prompt the client to select another time slot from the availability of the same provider. The process is similar to the booking an appointment one.

The second option ‚ÄúCancel the consultation‚Äù will cancel the appointment for both the client and the provider.

Note:

- All changes made to an appointment will be confirmed using the notification service in app and by email for both of the consultation participants.
- Refunds for paid consultations will only be issued if the appointment is cancelled at least 24 hours prior to its scheduled start time.

### 6. Access the Information portal

Step 1: Login to the Client Interface.

Step 2: On the ‚ÄúNavigation Menu‚Äù select ‚ÄúInformation Portal‚Äù.

Step 3: Select either of the ‚ÄúView all‚Äù buttons on the right hand side, see Figure 22.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (60).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 22: Information Portal initial screen</p></figcaption></figure>

The initial entry screen for the information portal, as presented in Figure 22 is divided into two article groups - newest and most popular. For each section clients can choose the ‚ÄúView all‚Äù button which will redirect them to the Search screen in which more functionalities can be used to find the right content (see Figure 23).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (113).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 23: Information Portal Search Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Clients can use the search input to find different articles. Following the client's input, the view will dynamically update by displaying the articles that match the search criteria. Furthermore, clients can filter articles by choosing from a list of predefined categories.

Once the client finds an article about which he/she wants to read more, he/she can do so by selecting the ‚ÄúRead more‚Äù button within the article overview box, as highlighted in Figure 23.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (114).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 24: Full view of an article</p></figcaption></figure>

Figure 24 shows the full view of an article. The first part is a cover image. Next, we are presented with a list of tags that represent different psychological topics that are covered by the article. Following this, the title of the article together with the body and bibliography are displayed.

Note:

- Translations are supported as well. When changing the language, the clients will be presented with the translated version of the articles. In case some of the articles do not have a translated version for a specific language, then it will not be shown under the selected language.

### 7. Access the SOS Center

Step 1: Login to the Client Interface.

Step 2: Select the ‚ÄúSOS Center‚Äù button on the bottom right corner from any screen within the uSupport platform.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (119).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 25: SOS Centers Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

The SOS centre screen is the place which provides quick access to emergency lines available in different countries.

Figure 25 presents the available helplines, each within a different rectangle. The information which can be displayed is the following:

- Name of the emergency centre
- A description which should include relevant details about the centre so that the clients can know if the specific centre can solve their issue.
- A ‚ÄúContact now‚Äù button is displayed if the helpline accepts direct calls.
- A ‚ÄúVisit website‚Äù button is displayed if the helpline has a website.

Note:

- Translations are supported as well. When changing the language, the clients will be presented with the translated version of the SOS centres. In case an SOS centre does not have a translated version for a specific language, then it will be excluded from the results under that specific language.

### 8. Edit profile settings

Step 1: Login to the Client Interface.

Step 2: On the ‚ÄúNavigation Menu‚Äù select ‚ÄúYour Profile‚Äù.

From this screen the client can proceed with the following actions:

- Change their account personal details.
- Preview mood tracker past activity.
- Change the notification settings.
- Provide feedback for the application.
- Visualise payment History
- Raise an issue to the country administrator.
- Access the privacy policy.
- Access the frequently asked questions.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 26: Client account settings screen</p></figcaption></figure>

By accessing the profile details screen, the client can visualise the personal information associated with the uSupport client interface account, see Figure 27- the information inside the red rectangle. The client is able to change this data by selecting the ‚ÄúSave changes‚Äù button.

Moreover, from here the client can change the password for the account, enable or disable consent for personal data processing, log out and delete the account.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 27: Edit profile details screen</p></figcaption></figure>

From the profile settings, the client also has access to the mood tracker past activity page from where they can keep track of their progress while using the platform and see how their state of mind evolves.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (69).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 28: Mood Tracker screen</p></figcaption></figure>

From the notification settings screen the client can enable or disable the email notifications or the scheduled appointments notifications. Furthermore, clients can choose how long before an appointment they want to be notified - 15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes (see Figure 29).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (68).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 29: Notifications settings screen</p></figcaption></figure>

The application feedback form can be accessed as well from the profile settings. This form was created so that clients can provide their opinion about the platform. The screen, as we can see in the Figure 30, contains two parts, a star rating and a text message field. Once the client submits their feedback and sends the rating this will be received by the country administrators and managed accordingly.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (66).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 30: Application Feedback screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Clients are able to view a complete record of their purchases on the platform through the 'payment history' screen. This screen displays details such as the service purchased, the total price paid, and the date and time of the payment.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 31: Payment History screen</p></figcaption></figure>

To obtain more detailed information about a specific payment, the client can select the "More details" option located on the right-hand side of the screen, which will display comprehensive payment details. Furthermore, this feature also enables the client to download the payment receipt associated with the transaction (see Figure 32). In addition, clients have the option to export the data in CSV format by simply clicking the "Export" button.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 32: Payment History more information about a payment.</p></figcaption></figure>

The ‚Äòcontact us‚Äô screen allows clients to raise any questions or issues they might encounter. These will be received and addressed by the country administrators. To raise an enquiry, the client needs to select an issue from a predefined list and add any message if necessary, see Figure 33.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (122).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 33: Contact us screen</p></figcaption></figure>

The privacy policy can be previewed from the profile settings screen, as well.

Note:

- Privacy policies, terms of use and cookie policies are country specific. Clients should read and make sure the existing content is understood and their activity within the platform follows the established rules.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 34: Privacy policies screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Within frequently asked questions clients can find answers to the most commonly asked questions. It is recommended to visit this page every time there is any ambiguity regarding the use of the platform as the answer already might be there.

The information which is presented on this screen is managed by the country administrators and is country specific.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (65).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 35: Frequently asked questions screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Note:

- Translations are supported as well. When changing the language, the clients will be presented with the translated version of the FAQs. In case some of them do not have a translated version for a specific language, then they will be excluded from the results under that specific language.

### 9. Access the dashboard

Step 1: Login to the Client Interface.

Step 2: On the ‚ÄúNavigation Menu‚Äù select ‚ÄúHome‚Äù.

This screen provides quick access to different functionalities provided within the client interface, which have all been covered within this document, see Figure 36

At the top of the screen we are presented with the upcoming consultation and option to manage it. Then we have a quick access to the mood tracker. Furthermore, the information portal is presented here as well, with some limited functionalities and an option to navigate to the Information portal search screen.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (123).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 36: Dashboard screen</p></figcaption></figure>

### 10. Make a payment <a href="#_ref130341549" id="_ref130341549"></a>

Step 1: Login to the Client Interface.

Step 2: Follow the ‚ÄòSchedule consultation‚Äô flow described in section 4 Schedule a consultation

Clients who wish to make a payment will be directed to the payment screen, which presents two different payment options. These options are outlined below, along with explanations for each of the fields required to complete the payment process.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 37: Default payment form</p></figcaption></figure>

The first payment option available to users is to proceed with the standard payment process by completing all of the fields within the form presented above. These fields include:

- Email
- Card number
- Expiry date of the card
- CVC code
- Country or region
- Additional details required based on country (e.g. postcode for United Kingdom)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 38: Saving payment details for future usage.</p></figcaption></figure>

The users can also utilize the auto-fill features offered by ‚ÄúLink‚Äù as an alternative payment option. When entering an email address that has not been previously used for payments and is not associated with an existing Link account, an automatic check will be initiated. The user will then be given the option to save the payment details for future use (as shown in

Figure 39). The auto-fill functionality of ‚ÄúLink‚Äù is a product provided by Stripe that enables secure storage and auto-completion of payment information, thus streamlining the checkout process.

Figure 39 shows an example where a client enters an email address that is not recognized by Stripe. In response, the form displayed below prompts the user to provide additional information for securely storing and creating an account, namely a valid phone number, legal first and last names. Once the user enters this information along with valid card details to complete the payment, the information is securely linked to a new ‚ÄúLink‚Äù account. The result is that when the user accesses the payment form next time and enters the same email address followed by the two-factor authentication code, the form will be automatically filled with the previously saved payment details, as illustrated in Figure 40.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (67).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 39: Payment form Link account verification.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 40: Payment form use saved payment information.</p></figcaption></figure>

After accessing the payment form shown in Figure 41, the client can manage their payment methods by adding or removing them. Additionally, they have the option to use existing payment methods to complete the payment process.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (63).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 41: Payment form Link authentication completed.</p></figcaption></figure>

### 11. Access My Q\&A

Step 1: Login to the Client Interface.

Step 2: On the ‚ÄúNavigation Menu‚Äù select ‚ÄúMy Q\&A‚Äù.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 42: My Q&#x26;A screen.</p></figcaption></figure>

This screen allows clients to access a question and answer directory that is designed to help them clarify any questions they may have. Clients can ask questions anonymously and experienced providers will provide answers to them. The answers to questions will also be available to other clients.

As shown in Figure 42, the questions are organized into different tabs: All, Most Popular, Newest, and Your Questions. The first tab presents all the questions raised on the platform and answered by providers. The tab category displays the questions that are most popular, based on the number of likes they have received from clients. The third tab shows the newest questions that have been raised. The fourth tab displays the questions raised by the current client.

To ask a new question, clients need to click on the ‚ÄúAsk anonymously‚Äù button on the right side of the screen, then add their question as shown in Figure 43. After the client has finished adding their question, they can submit it by clicking the ‚ÄúSend your question‚Äù button. Following this procedure, the question will be displayed in the ‚ÄúYour Questions‚Äù tab and will be available to providers.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (62).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 43: My Q&#x26;A ad new question.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 44: My Q&#x26;A entry example.</p></figcaption></figure>

The My Q\&A screen contains several elements for each entry, as shown in Figure 44:

- Title
- Tags
- Question
- Answer
- The provider who answered the question

Additional features include:

- A shortcut to schedule a consultation
- Like/dislike buttons
- A "Read more" option

The schedule consultation shortcut is located in the bottom right corner of the entry and is displayed when a provider has answered the question. This allows clients to easily book a consultation with the provider who provided an answer on the topic they raised.

The like and dislike functionality can be accessed using the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons in the top right corner. The counters displayed indicate the number of clients who have expressed their opinion.

The read more functionality allows clients to view the entire answer to a question, as shown in Figure 45.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 45: My Q&#x26;A full text of a question.</p></figcaption></figure>

Furthermore, the clients have the ability to filter the answered questions by tags or utilize the search function, which will match the results based on the Q\&A entry's title and tags as presented in Figure 46.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 46: My Q&#x26;A filtering options.</p></figcaption></figure>
