### Introduction

Dear colleagues,

This guide will present the Country Admin interface which is part of the USupport platform. Its role is highly important as it allows country representatives to manage content and the team of people working to provide psychological support.

### What is the Country Admin Interface?

The Country Admin Interface is a custom-built web-based application for the users that will manage the individual countries within the USupport project.

This platform aims to provide an easy-to-use interface that delivers the necessary capabilities to manage content and providers for a specific country.

### User Roles

The Country Admin interface provides a single-user role.

### 1.   Country Admin Role

This role provides the capabilities of managing the USupport platform on a country level from an administrative perspective. The Country Admins have the capability to perform the following actions:

* preview statistics,
* create and update providers' accounts,
* manage which content to be displayed within the information portal,
* manage which frequently asked questions to be displayed within the Client interface,
* manage which SOS centres to be displayed within the Client interface.
* analyse reports submitted by clients.

### Processes

### 1.   Login to the Country Admin Interface

Step 1:       Navigate to the Global Admin Interface (https://usupport.online/country-admin).

Step 2:       From the Welcome Screen select a country and a language.

Step 3:       Insert valid login credentials.

Step 4:       Insert OTP which was sent to the email address.

### 2.   Forgot Password

Step 1:       Select “I forgot my password” (see Figure 2).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image008.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 4: Forgot Password Screen</p></figcaption></figure>



If a valid and registered email address within the platform was provided, an automated email will be sent to it. The email will contain a temporary valid link that can be used to set a new password. Following this procedure, the user can access the account using the email address and the newly created password.

### 3.   Creating a new provider

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (108).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 10: Deactivate provider profile confirmation.</p></figcaption></figure>

Note:  After the provider's account is deactivated, they will lose the ability to make changes to their availability, join campaigns, propose consultations to clients, or show up in client searches. However, it's important to note that the provider will still have access to their account, be able to view their previous consultations, and conduct consultations that have already been scheduled.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (78).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 12: Provider Activity History</p></figcaption></figure>

By reviewing the activity history, the country administrator can access details regarding the consultations performed by the provider. This information includes the client's name, date and time of the consultation, consultation price, and the campaign through which the consultation was booked.

Additionally, the country administrator can export the displayed data in CSV format by clicking the export button and apply filters to the table using the filtering options provided below.

In Figure 14 we can see how a country administrator can preview the pool of available articles. Each article presents a summary that includes an image, the title and a description. To see the entire content, the “view” button should be clicked. This action will redirect to a new page that presents the entire information about the selected article.

In addition, the country administrator has the capability to utilize the search bar to locate a particular article and can conveniently arrange the results based on various columns that are available.

Frequently asked questions are created using the USupport CMS platform by moderators. The FAQs are presented in three different interfaces: Commercial Website, Client, and Provider, as for each interface, different questions might be more relevant than others. Therefore, the country administrators are able to choose different FAQs for each of the interfaces.
