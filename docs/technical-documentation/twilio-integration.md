### Introduction

Twilio is a powerful cloud communications platform that enables developers to integrate voice and video, capabilities into their applications. Twilio Rooms allow you to create real-time video communication between two participants (a client and a provider) in a secure and private manner.

### Creating a Twilio Room for Real-Time Video Communication

### Initial Setup (Prerequisite)

* &#x20;Active Twilio account
* &#x20;Twilio API credentials: Obtain Twilio API Key SID and Secret, which are necessary for generating Access Tokens.

### Workflow

#### Step 1:       Generating an Access Token

* The user (client or provider) sends a request to the USupport API, which is responsible for the communication to the Twilio API.
* &#x20;Include the consultation ID and detail ID of the user joining the room in the request body. This information helps identify the specific consultation and user details associated with the Room.
* &#x20;The USupport API receives the request and verifies the necessary parameters.
* The USupport API creates a JWT (JSON Web Token) Access Token using the Twilio API Key SID and Secret.
* The Access Token is signed with the Twilio API Key Secret and includes grants that govern the actions the client can perform.
* These grants determine what the user can do within the Twilio Video Room, such as publishing and subscribing to tracks.
* &#x20;Once the Access Token is generated, the USupport API sends it back to the user interface (UI) as a response.

Note: Access Tokens are short-lived credentials that provide secure access to Twilio services and define the permissions of the client holding the token

#### Step 2:       Connecting to the Twilio Room

* The user interface (UI) receives the Access Token from the USupport API.
* &#x20;Using the Twilio SDK (Software Development Kit), establish a connection to the Twilio Video service.
* &#x20;Pass the Access Token and the name of the Room(the ID of the consultation) when initiating the connection to authenticate and authorize the client or provider.The Twilio SDK handles the connection to the Twilio infrastructure.

#### Step 3:       Joining the Room and Establishing Peer-to-Peer Connection

* Upon successful connection, the client and provider join the Twilio Room.
* &#x20;The Twilio infrastructure establishes a peer-to-peer (P2P) connection between the participants.
* &#x20;This P2P connection enables the direct transmission of video and audio tracks between the client and provider.
* &#x20;The Twilio Room is designed to be end-to-end (E2E) encrypted, ensuring the privacy and security of the participants' communication.

#### Step 4:       Real-Time Communication and Data Transmission

* With the client and provider successfully joined in the Twilio Room, they can engage in real-time video communication.
* &#x20; Both participants can transmit their video and audio tracks through the established P2P connection.
* &#x20;The Twilio SDK handles the encoding, decoding, and synchronization of the media streams.
* &#x20;  The Twilio Room does not intercept or access the transmitted media, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of the participants.

#### Step 5:       Room Limitations

* &#x20; Keep in mind that a Twilio Room supports a maximum of two participantsâ€”one client and one provider.
* &#x20;If more than two participants are required, additional Rooms and connections would need to be established separately.

### Privacy & Security & Confidentiality

Security is a paramount concern when it comes to real-time video communication, and Twilio Rooms prioritize the privacy and protection of participants' data. Twilio Rooms implement end-to-end (E2E) encryption, ensuring that the media transmitted between participants remains confidential and secure. This encryption prevents any unauthorized access to the audio and video streams, providing a strong layer of protection against eavesdropping or interception.

In addition to E2E encryption, Twilio Rooms also enforce strict access controls through the use of Access Tokens. These short-lived credentials are signed with Twilio API Key Secrets and contain grants that define the permissions and actions a client can perform within the Room. By generating Access Tokens and validating them during the connection process, Twilio ensures that only authorized participants can join a Room, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access. These security measures combined help maintain the integrity and confidentiality of real-time video communication in Twilio Rooms, providing users with a secure environment to interact and collaborate.

As part of Twilio's commitment to privacy and security, the maximum number of users allowed to join a single Twilio Video Room Go is limited to two. This limitation ensures optimal performance and quality of the video communication experience between the client and the provider.

It's worth noting that Twilio strictly adheres to a "no interception" policy regarding the media transmitted within a Twilio Room. This means that Twilio does not access, monitor, or intercept any of the audio or video data exchanged between participants. The content of the communication remains confidential and private, safeguarding the integrity and privacy of the users' interactions. Twilio's commitment to non-interception reinforces the trust and security users can have when utilizing Twilio's video communication services.
